# thunder
Thunder is a simple Progressive Web App that helps you calculate how far away you are from lightning. Press once when you see the flash, press again when you hear the thunder. Based on the difference between the spead of light and sound, you can see how far away you are.

Thunder was the first App I built as a teenager, and to practice with PWA conventions and the Material Design Language, I've rewritten this little program using Vuetify.
